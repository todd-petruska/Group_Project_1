## Analysis of Crime Statistics from 2018-2022 in New Orleans, Louisiana. 

For this project, we decided to look into data from police reports in New Orleans from before the Covid-19 pandemic, during Covid-19 pandemic, and after Covid-19 pandemic. The data provided from the police reports were in csv files for each year. 
 
We started by reading in the 2018 csv file into a Jupyter Notebook to experiment with our cleaning and plotting processes for one year. We ran through our data to better understand it. We looked for the data types, and the length of the dataset. There was a timestamp in the original dataset for each call received from the department. The datastamp was given as year/month/day and then hour:minutes:seconds. We cleaned the DataFrame so there was only the year, month, and day.
